      <h1>My Favorite Discs</h1>
      <p>Everyone has an opinion and it is hard to find consensus on most topics.  Opinions about music are no different.  Your opinons on this subject are shaped by when you were born, where you were born, what country or culture you were born into, what you were listening to the first time you fell in love and a lot of other really emotion-related things.  Everyone has music that has touched them.  These are some of mine.</p>
