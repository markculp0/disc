      <p>Everyone has an opinion and it is hard to find consensus on most topics.  Opinions about music are no different.  Your opinions about music are shaped by when you were born, where you were born, what you were listening to the first time you discovered ice creme and a lot of other things that make you you.  This is the music you need to hear no matter who you are.</p>
